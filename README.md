# Title: File Processing and Checksum Verification Application

# Introduction:
I am excited to present my application for a File Processing and Checksum Verification role. I have developed a service that handles file transformation, checksum calculation, and JSON data management. This application ensures data integrity and facilitates seamless communication with external systems for verification and suggestion generation. Additionally, it enables file attachment to PDFs and performs checksum verification of the combined files. I am confident that my expertise in these areas will contribute to the success of your organization.

# Key Features:

   # File Transformation and Checksum Calculation:
        Converts original and attachment files into binary format for efficient processing.
        Utilizes industry-standard checksum algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) to calculate checksums.
        Stores file information and checksum data in JSON format, ensuring easy retrieval and management.

  # Seamless Communication with External System:
        Transmits the JSON file to an external system for checksum verification.
        Receives suggestions from the external system regarding the correspondence of binary files to the original and attachment.

  # File Attachment to PDF and Combined Checksum Verification:
        Integrates file attachment functionality to the PDF document.
        Verifies the checksum of the combined files (original and attachment with PDF) to ensure data integrity.

  # JSON Data Storage and Exchange:
        Stores relevant information, including checksums and suggestions, in JSON format.
        Facilitates secure transmission of JSON data between systems using encryption protocols.
